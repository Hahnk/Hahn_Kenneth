Q1: 

i = 0
while myList[i] >= 0:
   i += 1
location = i
 
Will only work if there is a negative number,
 because even if it is zero,
 it still gets one added to it as it moves up the list,
so it will never exit unless there is a negative number 

Q2: 
A list containing N values has a top index of n-1

Q3:
count = 0
for i in range(0, N):
   if list1[i] != 0:  # If it does not equal zero
       list1[count] = list1[i]
       count += 1 # increase count by one
list2 = []
for i in range(0, count):  # So, the range will only be as much AS many nonzero numbers there are
   list2.append(list1[i])
