                And said drink from me, drink from me
                (Oh-ah-oh-ah)
                That we shoot across the sky
                Symphony
                That we shoot across the sky
                Pour on a...
                Drink from me, drink from me
                (Oh-ah-oh-ah)
                That we shoot across the sky
                Symphony
                (So high, so high)
                That we shoot across the sky

                [Verse 1: Chris Martin]
                Oh, you just came from somewhere else
                You know you make my world go dark
                When I was down, when I was hurt
                You came to shout me down
                Life is a drink and love's a drug
                oh just to think that I was miles up
                When I was a river dried up
                You were the baking sun

                [Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin & Beyoncé]
                And said take from me, take from me
                When I was so thirsty
                I wove a symphony
                Now you wont let me go
                take my wings, wings from me
                When I was so heavy
                while screaming at me
                that I just don't do enough

                [Chorus: Chris Martin]
                I-Oh-I-Oh
                Got me wishing just to die
                to die, to die
                Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh
                you have taken all my light
                my light, my light
                (Woo)
                (Woo-ooo-ooo-woo)

                [Verse 2: Chris Martin & Beyoncé]
                ooh, the darkness in your heart
                I feel it coursing through my blood
                oh in your soul and love is just
                that they make nightmares of

                [Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin & Beyoncé]
                put your chains, chains on me
                When I was once so free
                high as high could be
                now I'm low, low, low, low

                [Chorus: Chris Martin]
                I-Oh-I-Oh
                Got me wishing just to die
                to die, to die
                Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh
                you have taken all my light
                my light, my light
                (Woo)
                (Woo-ooo-ooo-woo)

                [Bridge: Beyoncé & Chris Martin]
                I-Oh-I-Oh
                La, la, la, la, la, la, la
                So high, so high
                I-Oh-I-Oh
                I'm feeling drunk and high
                So high, so high

                [Outro: Beyoncé]
