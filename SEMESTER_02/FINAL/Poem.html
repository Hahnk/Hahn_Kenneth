                    How Did You Die?<br>

                    Edmund Vance Cooke<br>
                    <br>



                    Did you tackle that trouble that came your way<br><br>
                    With a resolute heart and cheerful?<br><br>
                    Or hide your face from the light of day<br><br>
                    With a craven soul and fearful?<br><br>
                    Oh, a trouble's a ton, or a trouble's an ounce,<br><br>
                    Or a trouble is what you make it,<br><br>
                    And it isn't the fact that you're hurt that counts,<br><br>
                    But only how did you take it?<br><br><br><br>
                    You are beaten to earth? Well, well, what's that?<br><br>
                    Come up with a smiling face.<br><br>
                    It's nothing against you to fall down flat,<br><br>
                    But to lie there -- that's disgrace.<br><br>
                    The harder you're thrown, why the higher you bounce;<br><br>
                    Be proud of your blackened eye!<br><br>
                    It isn't the fact that you're licked that counts,<br><br>
                    It's how did you fight -- and why?<br><br><br><br>
                    And though you be done to the death, what then?<br><br>
                    If you battled the best you could,<br><br>
                    If you played your part in the world of men,<br><br>
                    Why, the Critic will call it good.<br><br>
                    Death comes with a crawl, or comes with a pounce,<br><br>
                    And whether he's slow or spry,<br><br>
                    It isn't the fact that you're dead that counts,<br><br>
                    But only how did you die?</h2><br>

                <p>
                    How did you die by Edmund Vance Cooke has been a defining force in my life all of my life,<br>
                    it has led me and helped me to grow ever since 6th grade, when I had to memorize it.<br>
                    It was located in a small poem book inherited from my great aunt, full of the great poems of the last century,<br>
                    and this poem resonated with me greatly, aided by the fact that this poem has been told to me before by my father<br>
                    when I was very young. This poem is to inspire strength, bravery, and honor. <br>
                    This poem taught me to be positive, to continue forward when times are tough, <br>
                    to take pride in my own self and to never give up. Life will give me beatings, but it cannot stop me. <br>
                    It cannot crush my spirit because I will not let it.  After memorizing this poem,<br>
                    I have been reminded of it many times, in times of great failure and strife.
                </p>
