                I am almost obligated to say that my favorite class in school would be english class. Both the sustenance of my soul and my most invaluable avenue for satisfaction and happiness in my life have been wrought from the hours spent in those lessons. Immeasurable wisdom and insight, depth of heart and soul; and true substance for which to build a balanced, joyful life, all came to me through those living tomes I poured over daily in order to achieve good grades and enjoy good fun. The Great Gatsby, The Giver, The Outsiders, Huckleberry Finn, Lord of the Flies, and more, all introduced to me from within the four walls of my classrooms.  From these sacred pages I learned humility, earnesty, accountability, the value of true friendship, and the bedrock from which I build my life, for which I am eternally grateful. But those golden hours spent learning of love and life did not take up the entirety of the class! I was given good feed to grow my large stock of vocabulary; and my pride and joy, my writing prowess, the latter of which facilitated the greatest joy in my life, the communication to and from other souls I am able to make contact with.  I have been able to craft communications with such a magnitude so that it would have been impossible had I not known there right words to truly speak my mind or bare my soul. The loves and friendships I have had both would be fathoms poorer had I lacked the depth of heart and mind to truly grow them and nurture them, knowing just how to express my feelings.  So, in that way, I owe a great honor to my english classes, for ultimately procuring all that I am and love on this good, green earth.

                I have never had as pure or true a leadership experience as when I sponsored a bill in the Youth in Government program, and personally led a committee of bill writers to aid me in changing california legislature. The bill Idea itself came from the committee our group was first created as, but when it was time to choose leadership  positions, I, hesitantly at first, stood to champion, or sponsor the bill, and lead it along the path to the senate chambers of sacramento, where I would fight for its ultimate fate. It was a challenge that I rose to graciously, inspiring, encouraging, and advising my committee members as they needed it. The rigors of leadership, toed with the necessity to make it appear effortless, and myself, fearless, instilled many traits in me that I still carry with me today. A mind for planning, of good foresight, and with quick and clear thinking. A heart for mentorship, encouragement, and motivation, in myself and others. As I continue to blaze trails through my life, whether through clubs or class projects or campaigning for a student leadership position, I will never forget my first brush with leadership. </p>
