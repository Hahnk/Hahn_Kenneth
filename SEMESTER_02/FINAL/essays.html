                Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a classical novel that comments on early 1800s<br>

                relationship norms, and the role of women in society. It involves a deep, complicated plot centered<br>

                around love and marriage, and is full of interesting, colorful characters. Characters that are, even<br>

                though they are timeless, are not completely unique. Most of the characters in this book are<br>

                classical archetypes, such as the Tragic Hero, the Villain, Shrew, and Free Spirit, their names<br>

                being Mr. Darcy, Mr. Wickham, Elizabeth Bennett, and her little sister, Lydia bennet.<br><br>


                Mr. Darcy, the flawed, suffering man who makes mistake after mistake through the book is<br>

                a classical Tragic Hero. After blundering through a one-sided romance between him and<br>

                Elizabeth, he attempts to propose to her, and is shot down horribly, saying that  "You are<br>

                mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other<br>

                way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in<br>

                a more gentlemanlike manner[Austen 109].” , showing just how much of his horrid manner has<br>

                obscured his good intentions. This Tragic Hero, with his pure heart and kind soul, has his actions<br>

                misunderstood and motives misinterpreted because of his demeanor. Truly, a Tragic Hero. But,<br>

                with every hero, there must be a Villain.<br><br>

                Mr. Wickham is the Villain of the book, and a despicable scoundrel to boot. He is<br>

                ludicrously self-serving, hurts many people and many families in pursuit of easy money and<br>

                easy girls, and has deceived both elizabeth and Mr. Darcy before. After running off with<br>

                her little sister, Elizabeth is beside herself, and laments that “"When I consider," she added in a yet<br>

                more agitated voice, "that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what he was. Had I but<br>

                explained some part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his character<br>

                been known, this could not have happened. But it is all--all too late now[50]." Mr. Wickham had<br>

                deceived them all, all for his own selfish purpose. He has victimized many just to further his own<br>

                goals, including a fourteen year old Free Spirit named Lydia Bennett.<br><br>

                Lydia Bennet is the Youngest of the Bennett sisters, and a dictionary definition of the Free<br>

                Spirit.  In ceaselessly pursuing men for such a young age she shows a great disregard for<br>

                danger, in caring for nothing but her own pleasures and feelings she is very hedonistic, and her<br>

                elopement with Wickham shows extreme irresponsibility of the highest degree. Her older sister<br>

                Elizabeth looks upon the sorry, sad state of her sister and her marriage, she thinks of “ how little of<br>

                permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their<br>

                passions were stronger than their virtue[170].” Led only by her wild feelings and flitting desires,<br>

                she leads herself to ruin, and her entire family to shame.<br><br>

                In literature, different characters are bound to be similar as the numerous stories are<br>

                created over the years. Such character tropes, while prevalent, do not lessen the creative worth of<br>

                the work they are found in.  In Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, there are several classical<br>

                archetypes, such as the Tragic Hero, the Villain, the Shrew, and the Free Spirit. These classical<br>

                characters, named Darcy, Wickham, Elizabeth, and Lydia perfectly match their archetype, but as<br>

                they interact with each other and unique social issues for Jane Austen’s time period, they are just<br>

                as interesting, and just as relevant to today’s society. People still make mistakes with the best<br>

                intentions. People still can become ill with greed and do horrible things. People still stand up to<br>

                authority figures and ignore all proper responsibility. And people still read Jane Austen’s Pride and<br>

                Prejudice, to learn about these human, relatable characters.
