                    Everybody Laughing at Me: A Story of Triumph<br><br>

                    It was in a Barnes and Noble book store that I first saw The Friars Club Book of 2069 Rather
                    Naughty Jokes.  I knew it was unfit for a kid like me, but with much cajoling and eye-rolling, I was
                    carrying it out of the store, beaming. I absorbed  myself into it,
                    reading it night and day, and had completely memorised every joke in the book in little under a day.
                    Little did I know the massive impact that that small book would have on my life.
                    Camp fox, nestled in scenic buttonshell beach, Catalina island, at that time held 500 Kids,
                    the leaders, and me, now offering 2069 chances at finally fitting in.
                    For the first time in my life, I had something that could set me apart,
                    make me likable, attract people who wanted to be near me.  I was famous within a day,
                    drawing crowds, entertaining everyone around me, and even telling the counselors jokes while the other kids were busy.
                    That glimpse at popularity, at likability, at acceptance, was the first time I had ever felt confident in myself,
                    and that brief window at what l could become permanently raised the standards  I had set for myself.
                    I expected more of myself than to be the quiet, repulsive kid off in the corner,
                    looking back at the world from the outside. I saw the big, wide world and didn’t tell myself it was reserved for someone else.
                    I started to explore, to plan, to achieve.  That moment laid the groundwork for all of the successes I am able to boast about to this day.
                    With the higher expectation of myself came a higher drive to do quality work, inside and outside of school.  As my confidence grew,
                    I got much more involved in the programs Model United Nations, and Youth in Government,
                    I was doing things so fantastic it was like I was a spectator to myself as I left the blazing trail of success that I achieved.
                    I sat back in awe while crowds of peer senators all cheered in support of the bill I was sponsoring, as it passed.
                    I cheered for myself as the judge commented that my team of lawyers would not have won its case if I hadn’t impeached the witness so expertly.
                    I cried sweet tears of joy, in shock and awe, at how with a few words and a firm handshake,
                    I was able to inspire a dear friend of mine to run for youth governor of California.
                    And now, I can only lean back, away from myself as I look towards another year in my program,
                    and shield my eyes so my flames do not blind me. That drive to succeed was and is electrifying,
                    and came with that golden realization that victory was possible.  Starting a business, creating an invention, exploring the darkest reaches of space, revolutionizing the world are all feats that were not achieved by people believing that they were insignificant and unimportant.  They did not change the world, could not change it while they felt self doubt and insecurities shackle them.   The possibility of success,  was all that I needed to shine, light up that fire of self-motivation and determination, and even still I am in awe of that glow within me.  In school, I devour my courses and revel in my little achievements like acing a test or crafting a beautiful essay, but that's only because I can’t be off creating Non Governmental Organizations, lobbying bills, and running for youth governor every day!   Though I relish my everyday victories, not even the loftiest goal or most wild dream cannot be claimed as my own.  I fully know now I can achieve true greatness, and that’s no joke.
