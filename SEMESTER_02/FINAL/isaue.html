            <p>Bathrooms. We are all demanded, from a very young age, to pick which of the two presented to us are the ones we should go into. But how do we choose? Which do we go into? Most teachers will tell us that is a choice based on if we are a boy or girl. Simple, right? Unless you are one of the 1.4 million adults who find the question to be something far less simple or innocent. The transgender population has a hard decision to make. Follow the rules laid out for them that make them feel horrible, or make the choice that would allow them to feel comfortable, but bring the ire of everyone around them. They have been fighting to have a gender neutral bathroom so they donâ€™t have to make that largely political and divisive choice.

                This transgender bathroom issue seems to be a little one in the broad scope of transgender treatment, but the choice is a dire one for them. By selecting that room and being punished accordingly, the teachers and school is showing their non-acceptance, and allowing the other children and society as a whole to see it as something condoned.  In this way, the continued denial of the ability to make that choice continues the systematic abuse transgender individuals experience.

                Gender neutral bathrooms originated in universities, with a number of bills entering from multiple states and fighting a great years-long battle  with multiple steps forward and back in various states.

                There is already present legislature in many states, and if support is given to these proposals, we can  support transgender people all across america, and help push forward the advance of time.


                Transgender bathrooms are about far more than simple places to do business. They are, for transgender people, places where they have to put themselves forward, in ways many of them are not comfortable with. They are bullied, sexually harrassed, and pressured into suicide at very high rates [3] and helping them hold onto respect and become more accepted is very worthwhile a topic.<br>
