                    My Adventure in Germany

                    COST<br>
                    http://www.cheapflights.com/flights-to-nuremberg/california/<br>
                    For around 700$, I can fly to my great auntâ€™s house in germany, and stay there for free for one year as I learn about my herritage, visit with family, etc.
                    I do not currently work, but if I get a job at my Local YMCA, where I hope to work, I will earn about ten dollars an hour, and at seven days a week working, it would take me about seven weeks at ten dollars an hour to pay for the plane ride. Extra money, around 200 extra dollars for expenses will be covered by my personal funds. Once I arrive, I shall rely on family for room and board.
                    <br>
                    Reason<br>
                    My grandmother is german, and I have lots of family in germany. I have never had much of a connection with my long-distance relations, and I would love to learn the language, connect with family, make friends, enjoy and learn about the culture.
                    <br>
                    PLAN<br>
                    After arriving at my great aunts house, I will begin the tour, seeing the germanic castles, the rhine river, partaking in Oktoberfest,  and  working at my families clock repair business, while I relax and bond with family.
